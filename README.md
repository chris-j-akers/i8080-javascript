# Intel 8080 JavaScript Emulator <!-- omit in toc -->

This Repo contains the following:

* An Intel 8080 CPU emulator written in JavaScript, plus various other components that can be used to build a virtual machine with the Intel 8080 as its processor.

* A 'Space Invaders' emulator which uses the 8080 virtual machine components to run the original 1978 game ROM in a modern web browser using React (all client-side). To see this in action, visit: http://8080.cakers.io.

* A 'CPU Diag' emulator that also runs on the 8080 virtual machine components. 'CPU Diag' is a piece of software written in 1980 by Kelly Smith of *Microcosm Associates*. It tests the 8080 chip is in full working order. The version in this repo runs in a simple static website, and requires a running web-server to use (albeit a small, simple one such as 'live-server' or `python -m SimpleHttpServer`).

* Unit tests for nearly all of the 8080 operations in 'Mocha' format
* The Unit Test Generator App
* An app to convert 8080 ROM binary files into JavaScript arrays of bytes.

# 1. 8080 Core Components

In `/src/core`, the following JavaScript classes can be used to form a simple virtual machine with an 8080 CPU at its core. 

## 1.1. `i8080.js`

The 8080 CPU component which emulates all 8080 operations and contains a few debug functions that output strings related to the current state of the CPU. It also contains a method for executing lines of 8080 binary commands (OpCodes).

## 1.2. `mmu.js`

A simple class used to store the RAM of the machine (in a `Number` `Array`) and provide an interface for reading and writing to the RAM.

## 1.3. `bus.js`

A class used to connect the CPU, MMU and any additional devices together. CPU operations that use RAM, for instance, only interact with the bus which passes the request to the `MMU`.

Devices are added to `Read` and `Write` arrays in positions that reflect the ports they are hooked up to. For instance, the 'Space Invaders' custom bit-shift device (see below) is added to the `Read` array at positions `2` and `4` and the `Write` array at position `3` because these are the three ports it uses to communicate with the CPU via the `IN` and `OUT` opcodes.

## 1.4. `device.js`

An abstract class that provides an interface for any device that needs to be connected to the bus. This just ensures each device provides a `Read()` and a `Write()` method. It can't be instantiated directly.

## 1.5. Core Component Class Diagram

Core components and their relationships are below.

# 2. Testing

## 2.1. Unit Tests 

Unit tests cover nearly all the 8080 operations. They are automatically generated by the `test_generator.py` application found in `/utils` which reads in a set of `YAML` config files to generate JavaScript Mocha test suites. This simple application saves a lot of time in maintaining unit tests that contain very similar boilerplate code but expect slightly different results.

To generate Unit Tests:

```shell
cd utils/test_generator
python3 ./gen_i8080_unit_tests.py
```

## 2.2. Running Unit Tests
Unit tests are written to: `/src/unit_tests` and require Mocha to run (`npm install`). To execute all tests, should be as simple as:

```bash
i8080-javascript/src/unit_tests on  main [!] 
➜ npm run test
```
There are 428 tests in total and all should pass cleanly.

## 2.3. Unit Test Methodology
Unit tests are written to closley resemble the way the i8080 programs would be executed. Instead of directly accessing internal members of the i8080 class to set-up, execute and tear-down tests, we use small binary programs stored in arrays that consist of a sequence of 8080 opcodes and operands. Basically, Unit teests are all mini 8080 executables.

For instance, one of the tests to check the `JNC` (Jump if Carry Not Set) command executes this sequence of bytes stored in an array called `program`.

```javascript
		let program = [
		  0x3E,                   // MVI into accumulator
		  255,                    // ...this byte
		  0x26,                   // MVI into Register H...
		  0xFF,                   // ...This high-byte
		  0x2E,                   // MVI into Register L...
		  0xFE,                   // ...This low-byte
		  0x36,                   // MVI into memory location (stored in registers H/L)
		  0x76,                   // ...OpCode 0x76 (So the program HALTS when the program counter changes if a jump occurs)
		  0xC6,                   // ADI...
		  10,                     // ...This immediate value to accumulator
		  0xD2,                   // JNC
		  0xFE,                   // ..This low-byte
		  0xFF,                   // ...and this high-byte
		  0x76,                   // HALT
		]
```
The above sequence executes the following on the 8080 CPU:

1. Load the immediate value `255` (`0xFF`) into the accumulator (the largest number it can store).
2. Load a 16bit memory address (`0x26FF`) into the `H` and `L` registers
3. Call the `MVI` command to load immediate value `0x76` (the HALT opcode) into the 16bit address now loaded into the `H` and `L` registers (`0x26FF`).
4. Add the immediate value `10` (`0xA`) to the accumulator, which should set the CPU Carry bit.
5. Call the `JNC` instruction. 

The expected result of this test is that a jump should *not* occur becaue the carry bit was set during the `ADD` operation in step 4. The test will pass or fail, therefore, depending on the value of the CPU's Program Counter field when the test is complete.

This method ensures that the emulator is tested as close to its real operation as possible.

## 2.4. CPU Diag (1980)

CPU Diag is an 8080 assembler program written in 1980 by Kelly Smith of *Microcosm Associates*. It’s full source can be found in this repo in `documentation/cpu-diag`. It is designed to test the functionality of the 8080 chip and, therefore, was the first piece of software I wanted to get running in the emulator.

The program runs as a small, static website and requires a simple local webserver to run such as the one that ships with Python:

```shell
>cd src/cpu-test-program
>python -m SimpleHttpServer
```
Once the server is running, select the `cpudiag-page.html` file to load the main screen.

The back-end of the program runs in a similar way to *Space Invaders* so details won't be repeated here, suffice to say that a Web Worker is used to prevent the browser locking up.

### 2.4.1. Instructions

The various internal CPU registers and fields are displayed along the top. On the bottom left is the trace window which outputs a disassembly of each instruction as it is executed. In the middle is the console output and on the right, the RAM contents. 

The buttons in the middle provide a couple of different ways to run the program which helped when debugging.

* `Run Clocked at Speed` slows down the emulator to a number of instructions per second. This is really just so you can observe the fields being updated easily, otherwise its too quick.
  
* `Run Unclocked` just executes the whole program as quickly as possible.
  
* `Step Single Instruction` allows you to step through the program instruction-by-instruction.
  
* `Run to Breakpoint` will execute the program up to the memory address entered in the text-box.

The expected result is for the phrase ` CPU IS OPERATIONAL` to pop out of the console. If there are any issues, the phrase `  CPU HAS ERRORS` will pop out instead. This text output actually used some old CP/M kernel routines that had to be trapped and emulated. See source for details.

*NOTE: Proof that time invested in unit testing pays off arrived when the emulator reached this stage. When I first ran this program, I expected to mired in 8080 assembler, as I faced plenty of failures. In fact, the only issue I encountered was the `DAA` instruction. An instruction that I hadn’t fully implemented, yet, and hadn’t written any unit tests for. A lot of others writing 8080 emulators actually skipped this instruction because it wasn’t used very much, at least in games. I was in two-minds on whether to implement it myself or skip it. In the end, it is fully implemented and passes all tests in `CPU Diag`.*

# 3. Implementing Space Invaders

*Space Invaders* seemed a logical, if slightly cliched choice for emulation. It also has a great write-up on [Computer Archeology](https://www.computerarcheology.com/Arcade/SpaceInvaders/) and there are a few other implementations out there so, if I got stuck, I had references available. The [Hardware](https://www.computerarcheology.com/Arcade/SpaceInvaders/Hardware.html) section in the above link provides the most useful information along with a few suprises.

## 3.1. Components

Below is the updated class diagram that includes the additional *Space Invaders* components and how they interact with each other and the core 8080 virtual machine components.

## 3.2. Space Invaders Class Diagram

![Space Invaders UML](/documentation/diagrams/uml-diagrams/space-invaders-uml.drawio.png)

## 3.3. Video

### 3.3.1. The Video Buffer

According to [Computer Archeaology](https://www.computerarcheology.com/Arcade/SpaceInvaders/Hardware.html), the 8080 'Space Invaders' video memory is located betwen addresses `0x2400` and `0x3FFF`. How is that memory interpreted into the screen image? For older analogue displays, hardware in the computer would read these sections of RAM and interpret them into electronic signals that are sent to the monitor in the cabinet. The monitor draws the image one line at a time from the top down. When the last line at the bottom of the screen has been drawn, an interrupt is sent to the CPU called a 'Vertical Blank'. This tells the CPU that the screen has been refreshed so it has some time to update the video memory with the next frame before the drawing starts agin. 

The CPU typically had about 16ms to update video memory before another attempt was made to re-draw the screen, but *Space Invaders* is a little different because it generates two interrupts: One when the screen has been half-way drawn and one when the screen has been fully drawn. Important sprite positioning code is updated during both these interrupts, so they must be emulated.

It is critical that screen updates are in sync with video ram updates to avoid a side-effect known as 'tearing'. Imagine if the monitor has just drawn the top of a sprite at position (0,1) but, before it finished, the video RAM updates the sprite to position 0,5. The rest of the sprite will be drawn to the screen in the different position, making it look disjointed or 'torn'.

### 3.3.2. Colour Palette

Each pixel in the display is represented by 1 bit of display memory. If the bit is `0` then the pixel is off, or black, if it's `1` then it is on, or white. Screenshots and photographs of the early arcade machine may show the aliens and player's spaceship in different colours, but that was just a trick acheived by sticking coloured cellophane over certain sections of the cabinet's monitor. Space Invaders is a black and white game. One advantage of a black and white game, of course, is that we can save time by ensureing our background is always black and only drawing the white pixels.

### 3.3.3. Roated Screen

One thing that's apparent when seeing *Space Invaders* emulation results for the first time is that the video data is written to the video buffer at a 90 degree angle. To resolve this back in the '70s, they simply rotated the monitor in the original arcade cabinet by 90 degrees. We don't have that luxury, here. It is resolved in this emulator by temporarily rotating the context of an html canvas, outputting the contents of the video buffer, then rotating it back each time the frame is drawn.

## 3.4. Additional Hardware

The Space Invaders arcade machine included some additional, custom hardware that connected to the 8080 through device ports.

### 3.4.1. Bit-Shift Device



### 3.4.2. Controller Devices

## 3.5. Front-End

The front-end was written using *React*. 

### 3.5.1. Implementing the Web Worker

# 4. Why JavaScript?

Originally, this project was started in `C`. After all, research suggested this was the language most people wrote their emulators in and would also serve to illustrate just how fucking hard-core I am when it comes to programming, but as I got going a few issues appeared on the horizon:

- Emulating 8080 software, in particular games, means drawing graphics, playing sounds and controlling sprites. For C, some sort of display library like `SDL` would have to be used and, therefore, studied, whereas a modern web browser has all that capability built-in and can easily controlled using a well-known and ubiquitous scripting language.

- This is a personal research project, but I still want people to be able to access a demo easily without having to download an executable and deal with all the hand-wringing secuity issues that entails, plus I didn't want to have to provide a set of exeuctables for different OS types. This way, I can just stick it on the web. For instance, here: [http://8080.cakers.io](http://8080.cakers.io).

- Chromium-based browsers have great dev tools built in. It was either that or spending some more quality time with `GDB` which - and I'm sorry - just isn't pretty enough.

- Time is a factor. I have a family and work on the emulator could only really be done when a couple of hours were snatched each evening or during nap-time (the baby's, not mine). I didn't want to spend those precious few hours chasing down endless, fucking segmentation errors. A high-level language is better suited to this rapid-development requirement.

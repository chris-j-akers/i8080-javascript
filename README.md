# Description

This repo contains an Intel 8080 CPU emulator written in JavaScript (`/src/i8080.js`) and various other components that can be used to build a virtual machine with the Intel 8080 as its processor. 

An emulator of the original 1978 version of 'Space Invaders' which demonstrates these components can be found in `/emulators/space-invaders`. It uses a simple React front-end to present the game emulator in the clients browser. To see this in action, visit: http://8080.cakers.io.

## Repo Contents

`/src`

Core emulator and virtual machine code. Includes `i8080.js`.

`/src/__tests__`

Unit tests. These tests should not be modified directly as they are generated by the `test_generator` tool described below.

`/src/test_generator`

A python app and configuration for generating all unit tests used when writing `i8080.js`. This app allows multiple permutations of tests to be generated for each 8080 OpCode without having to manually type out thousands of lines of boiler-plate. The tests are configured using Yaml files and the tool `gen_i8080_unit_tests.py` reads the files and spits out the required JavaScript code to the `/src/__tests__` directory. Unit tests are written for 'Mocha', so this needs to be installed using `npm`.

`/roms/`

Original binary dumps of ROMs. Note that the emulator cannot read these directly as it would mean accesing client's file-systems. Instead they are converted to JavaScript arrays of bytes using the tool found in `/utils/rom_extractor`.

`/utils/`

Utilities used to assist with writing the emulator. Currently contains just the code for the `rom_extractor` (see above) which extracts bytes from binary ROM dumps and converts them into JavaScript arrays so they can be imported and read by the emulator.

`/emulators`

Actual software emulators that use the 8080 components found in this repo to run 8080 software. Currently just contains one application which emulates the original 'Space Invaders' ROM through a browser.

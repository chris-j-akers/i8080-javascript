# Description

This repo contains an Intel 8080 CPU emulator written in JavaScript (`/src/i8080.js`) and various other components that can be used to build a virtual machine with the Intel 8080 as its processor. 

An emulator of the original 1978 version of 'Space Invaders' can also be found in `/emulators/space-invaders`. It uses a simple React front-end to run the emulator in the clients browser. To see this in action, visit: http://8080.cakers.io.
